                Hello!
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                As you probably guessed by the title this is the section where I get to tell you a little bit about
                myself. So here I go!
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I was born in a small town in Texas but now call Kansas City home, where I live with my amazing wife and
                three beautiful children. Currently, I am enrolled at KU coding bootcamp program with the intent of
                becoming a full-stack web developer.
            </p>

            <br>

            <P>
                In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, playing my guitar and going to
                concerts and movies. I love art, especially photography, and exploring new places around the city.
            </P>
